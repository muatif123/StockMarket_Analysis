This is Natural Language Processing(NLP) algorithm used in the data to carry out sentiment analysis on BSE data of the stocks.
Firstly, the numerical analysis is done on the 'Closing' price of the dataset, to predict  the stocks
Secondly, sentiment analysis is done on the headlines of the stocks data in order to predict the stocks

Both the analysis is merged to get a combined analysis of the BSE data.
